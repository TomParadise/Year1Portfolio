Created in Unity and inspired by MC Escher, this project was made to implement the idea of reality-shifting environments into a playable space.

By using multiple cameras, render textures, and teleportation to create a seamless transition through the portal, the player gets the impression of non-euclidean geometry in interesting and engaging locations.

These techniques could be used to create maze-like environments and puzzles for players to explore and figure out. The examples in the video and screenshots display some creative implementations not often explored in games. Also, gravity is redirected once entering through a portal so the possibilities are vast.

To allow for the gravity shift, a custom player controller was required for appropriate interactions with stairs in multiple directions.
