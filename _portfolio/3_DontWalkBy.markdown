Inspired by lemmings, Don't Walk By is focused on the theme of health and safety where you appropriately deal with hazards to safely lead your pals to the exit!

Created by a final year university cohort of 33 students split into groups of 7, the game features:
<ul>
	<li>Unique abilities to direct and assist the peeps</li>
	<li>Dangerous hazards to avoid</li>
	<li>Hand crafted levels</li>
	<li>Level editor tools</li>
</ul>

My role in this project was to implement the hazard manager system which controls and manages the spawning and interactions of the hazards (fires, electricity, water buckets, vending machines/bookcases). I played the role of team leader in our group and met with the other team leaders to discuss progress, milestones, issues, and concerns with the overall game and individual elements and relayed the information back to my group to keep everyone connected and with the same level of understanding so progress could be smooth. I communicated with members of other groups directly for interactions between their systems and the hazard manager such as the emergency service ability removing hazards or the level creator placing and starting hazards.
